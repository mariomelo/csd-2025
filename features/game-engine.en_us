Feature: Game Engine - Guess Letter
  As a player
  I want to guess letters in the hangman game
  So that I can try to discover the secret word

  Background:
    Given the secret word is "scrum"
    And the game has been started

  Scenario: Player makes a wrong guess
    When I guess the letter "z"
    Then my number of lives should decrease by 1
    # And the letter "z" should be added to my guesses
    # And I should see a message saying the letter is not in the word
    But the game status should remain "RUNNING" if I have remaining lives
